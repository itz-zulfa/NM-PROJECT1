Our system leverages advanced machine learning models and user behavior analysis to dynamically match user preferences with relevant content, providing an engaging and tailored entertainment experience.

🚀 Features
📊 Intelligent User Profiling (based on watch history, ratings, and interaction)

🤖 AI-Powered Matchmaking Engine using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering

🧠 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing of movie metadata and reviews

🕵️ Context-aware personalization (e.g., time of day, trending content)

📈 Continuous Learning Model that adapts to user behavior over time

🧩 Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Flask/Streamlit (for frontend demo)

TMDB API for movie metadata

SQLite or MongoDB for data storage
